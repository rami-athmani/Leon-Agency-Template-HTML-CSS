I've drawn inspiration from the captivating design available at this link: https://www.graphberry.com/item/leon-psd-agency-template on graphberry.com. My project revolves around transforming this design into a functional HTML and CSS representation. Not only have I meticulously converted the design into code, but I've also taken the opportunity to enhance it to make it even more appealing and user-friendly. Dive into the project to witness how I've breathed life into the design and added my own unique touch to create an improved user experience.
